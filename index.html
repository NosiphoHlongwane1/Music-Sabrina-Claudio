            <h3 class="text-center">STORYTELLER.</h3>
            <p class="artist-text">
              "I like to think of myself as a storyteller" Sabrina shared this statement in an interview with apple music.
               Sabrina does not only write based on her life experiences but also channels the person she is not. 
              <br />
              <br />
              She is a R&B-rooted singer/songwriter who favors ballads that are low-key and aching in nature.
              As a youngster, she first soaked up the dance music she heard in her native Miami, Florida and was eventually drawn to pop-oriented contemporary R&B like Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child.
              <br />
              <br />
              Her music is known for its blend of soul and sensuality, and for exploring personal experiences and universal themes. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Sabrina Claudio has sold many copies of her music, including vinyl records, and has had over 2.5 billion streams. 
              She has also had sold-out tours.

                  <h4>Better version</h4>
                  <p>
                      This song stems from the perspective of someone who’s in a relationship with a person who is internally toxic, they choose to remain in this relationship because of those once in a blue moon glimpses of who their partner has the potential to be.
                      It feels like this person is in a relationship with two completely different people and doesn’t want to leave either of them at the risk of losing them both.

                    Rarely does he ever come to see me
                    But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
                    Like I earned it"
